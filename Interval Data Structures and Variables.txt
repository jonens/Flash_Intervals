Flash Scale Degrees (Major) Game Logic

1.  Implementing StatusModel.getKeySpec()

	a. Similar to Flash Key Signature
	
		1) Multiple tiers, based on the level
		
			a) Tier 1: Start with C Major only - treble and bass clef (clef can be chosen randomly)
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			b) Tier 2: Expand to G and F Major - treble/bass clef
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			c) Tier 3: Expand to D and Bb major - t/c
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			d) Tier 4: Expand to A, E, Eb, Ab major - t/c
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			e) Tier 5: Expand to B, Db major - t/c
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			f) Tier 6: Expand to F#, C#, Gb, C# major - t/c
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			g) Tier 7: Reduce to C, G, F major - alto
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			h) Tier 8: Reduce to C, G, F major - tenor
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			i) Tier 9: Expand to D, A, E, Bb, Eb, Ab - alto
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			j) Tier 10: Expand to D, A, E, Bb, Eb, Ab - tenor
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			k) Tier 11: Expand to B, F#, C#, Db, Gb, Cb - alto
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			l) Tier 12: Expand to B, F#, C#, Db, Gb, Cb - tenor
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
			m) Tier 13: Expand to B, F#, C#, Db, Gb, Cb - all
				(1) - no ledger lines
				(2) - one ledger line
				(3) - two ledger lines
		2) Total of 27 levels
		
	b. Variables and Data Structures required (all in StatusModel):
		1) Random Treble or Bass clef through Tier 6
		2) Alternate Alto / Tenor clef Tiers 7 - 12
		3) Random T/B/A/N for Tier 13
		4) Alternate Ranges for notes:
			a) no ledger lines for all odd-numbered levels 1 - 25
			b) one ledger line for all even-numbered levels 2 - 26
			c) two ledger lines for level 27
		5) Scale Degrees 1 - 7 can be used randomly at any level
			a) properties: numeric name, solfege name, technical name
			b) correct match for each scale degree can be done easily by matching
				letter name (noteSpec) with appropriate letter name of key
				
				-- Scenarios:
					(1) Base: 
						Key Signature: C Major
						Note:	C
						Scale Degree: 1 = do = tonic
						NoteIndex: 0
					
					(2) Transpose:
						Key Signature: D Major
						Note:	C(#)
						Scale Degree: 7 = ti = leading tone
						NoteIndex: 0
						
					(3) Transpose:
						Key Signature: Eb Major
						Note: C
						Scale Degree: 6 = la = submediant
						NoteIndex: 0
						
			c) to get the circumflex to show above a number, use layers in CSS
